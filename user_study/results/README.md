# Results

The results of the three groups of participants are given here in three separate files.

The participants had comparable prior experience with. Thogh, the experience for the group with score-based recommendations was a bit lower.

As result of the experiments, we measured the duration, the number of attempts, and thenumber of actions needed to reach the objective. Also, we asked each participant by what they were supported and by what they were hindered to reach their objective.

## Attempts

Given recommendations, participants did not do any mistakes and reached their goal in the first attempt.

## Number of Actions

Furthermore, the number of actions needed to satisfy the goal was measured. The participants without recommendations needed on average 20 actions. Four out of seven managed to reach the goal with a minimal number of actions, which is 19. With filter-based recommendations, all but one participant reached the goal with a minimal number of actions. On average that was 19.4. Being assisted with score-based recommendations, all participants needed only 19 actions. 

## Duration

Given recommendations, the participants were able to reach their goals faster than without. Also, score-based recommendations were an even better assistance.

For the duration, a t-test is applied that returns a value of -2.18 with a degree of freedom of 9.66 and a p-value of 0.027. For a confidence interval of 95\%, this confirms the third hypothesis.
