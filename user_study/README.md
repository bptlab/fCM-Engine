# User Study

To evaluate how filter-based and score-based recommendations can assist knowledge workers in reaching their objectives, a user study was conducted. This repository documents the setup and results of this user study.

Three groups of participants were investigated. Each group was provided with an enriched version of the fCM execution engine. The first group did not receive recommendations. For the second group, the engine was enriched with filter-based recommendation. The third group received score-based recommendations in their engine.

Each participant was provided with the process model, the execution engine and the objective.

As result of the experiments, we measured the duration, the number of attempts, and thenumber of actions needed to reach the objective. Also, we asked each participant by what they were supported and by what they were hindered to reach their objective.
